SecureComp is an application aimed at aiding Network Security and Application Security
It is intuitive, easy-to-use, and is meant to enhance the security of a user


HOW TO USE

The first feature is the Network Monitoring Mode. Turning it on begins the live capture
of network traffic coming into and out of the system. Any popups that come on the anaysis 
screen can be further investigated using the 'Security Knowledgebase' button

One can stop the network monitoring mode, which will then print the analysis results and save it
in a file that can be accessed later with 'View Previous Logs'

Another feature that a user is encouraged to use is the Update All Applications feature. Pressing 
it will prompt the user for their system password, upon entering it will start to update all the 
packages on the system. In the rare case that the feature to upgrade and update your system's packages doesn't 
work, then it is recommended to use these commands in order on the system terminal, in order 
to fix your issues and update your packages:
'sudo apt-get clean'
'sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*'
'sudo apt-get clean'
'sudo apt-get update'
'sudo apt-get upgrade'

There are a few Quality-of-Life features available for use. In the File/Config section, you can 
configure the packets/second threshold for the DoS Checker to decide the threshold over which 
a stream of internet traffic would be classified as a DoS attack. You can also modify the port
scan threshold which decides how many ports would be scanned by a source over which the system
flags it as a port scan attempt (in the case of a user knowing that a certain stream of packets
would be coming over several ports and wishes to prevent a flag being raised). Another available 
feature is 'Dark Mode', where the application switches to a darker theme, for the users that favour 
that aesthetic.
